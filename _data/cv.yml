      institution: MIT Beaverworks, Cambridge, MA
      year: 2019
      description:
        - Nominated by 3 teachers and then selected to be a student at Beaverworks, an intensive all-expenses paid summer program hosted by MIT.
        - At Beaverworks, worked in a team to learn and implement algorithms for self-driving RC vehicles using LIDAR and computer vision.

    - title: Intern
      institution: Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA
      year: 2019
      description:
        - Helped Boston College graduate researchers automate data collection using Python.
        - Data had previously been collected manually, and the machines required constant attending.
        - After the introduction of automated data collection, the machines were able to operate independently, saving the researchers lots of time.

    - title: Intern
      institution: Liberty Mutual, Dover, NH
      year: 2022
      description:
        - Assisted in the transition from old on-site databases to new cloud-based databases hosted on Snowflake.
        - Responsibilities included learning the functions of the old databases, and then attempting to recreate the same functions in the new cloud databases using node.js.

    - title: Researcher
      institution: UC Riverside, Riverside, CA
      year: 2023
      description:
        - Worked with PhD students and professors on a paper regarding the use of ML and NLP to detect Covid-19 misinformation in news articles.
        - Implemented the use of kernels and matrix decomposition in the classification algorithm to improve the accuracy of the model by up to 10%.

      year: 2019
      description:
        - A website that allowed high school students to pre-order deli sandwiches, and receive them at the cafeteria during lunch time.
        - The project was highly successful during its 2 month trial run, and saw considerable use.
        - Website was coded using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with mongodb as a database.
    - title: Face-Rec
      year: 2022
      description:
        - A machine learning program which was capable of recognizing facial features.
        - Written in Python using PyTorch and trained on the CelebA database (a database containing over 200,000 images of celebrities).
        - The program was able to accurately determine the facial features of random subjects who inserted a photo of themselves.
        - Final project for my machine learning class
    - title: <a href="https://github.com/Toasterdoodle/cs446p3">Custom Search Engine</a>
      year: 2023
      description:
        - Created a custom search engine that was able to search through a large database of scientific articles for articles related to a user's search query.
        - The search engine was capable of recognizing combinations of words that could potentially be phrases, and handling the phrases separately.
        - The search engine was able to rank each retrieved document with a score of how relevant it believed the document to be using natural language processing algorithms.
    - title: QuickReads
      year: 2023
      description:
        - An application that allows users to search for and read summarized news articles.
        - Users would enter a keyword they are interested in, and the application would fetch news containing the keyword, and then summarize it using chat-gpt.
        - Final project for my software engineering class.
