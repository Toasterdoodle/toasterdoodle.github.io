Hello, and thanks for looking at my personal site! I am currently a senior CS student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who will be graduating this fall of 2023. Right now, I am seeking new-grad software engineering positions, so feel free to reach out to me through my email (michaeljchen55@gmail.com) if you know of any available positions!

In my free time, I enjoy creating piano arrangements of popular music, as well as taking portrait photographs. If you would like to see some of the photos that I have taken, please feel free to check out my [500px!](https://500px.com/p/toasterdoodle?view=photos)

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
