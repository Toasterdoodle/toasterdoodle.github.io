At the cafeteria of Wayland High School, which is the high school I went to, they had this deli station where you could get custom made sandwiches, made to order, with whatever ingredients you wanted. Now this was by far the best meal option during lunch time, so naturally everyone tried to get one, and the line would always be incredibly long.

My junior year of high school, I was a taking a class called applied computer science, which is basically a class for people who already took AP Computer Science that let you use class time to work on various CS projects. Me and a couple of friends in that class came up with the idea of creating a website that allowed students to order sandwiches ahead of time, and then send a spreadsheet of every sandwich that was ordered to the lunch ladies so that they could prepare the sandwiches right before lunch time.

Me and two other students worked together, and created a functional website using CSS, HTML, and Javascript, and ran a small server using node.js to process student requests. We also coordinated with the lunch ladies to see what kind of features they required from our website.

In the end, the project was immensely successful. Within a week, roughly a hundred students were using our website every day, and the deli line in the cafeteria had never been shorter. At the end of the day though, the website was shut down at the end of the year, but for the few months that it was online, it was incredibly successful.
