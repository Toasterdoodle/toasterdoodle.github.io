For my final project for my information retrieval (search engines) class, we had to essentially create our own search engine from scratch. We were given a large database of academic articles, and essentially told to create a search engine that could search through this database for relevant articles when given a query.

My program used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25">BM25</a> ranking system, an was able to return a ranked list of potentially relevant documents, each document with a score of how relevant the algorithm believed it to be.
